                  <span class="boldclass">1.Cryocan- Liquid Nitrogen Dewars( 0.5 Ltr to 55 Ltr)</span><br><br>

                  Cryocan is a double walled non-pressurised Aluminium container used for storing Liquid Nitrogen. Cryocans are mainly
                  used to preserve bull semen under extreme cold temperatures i.e @ -196 Deg C in liquid Nitrogen. The bull semen thus
                  preserved is used for artificial insemination in the field to get a better breed of cows for higher milk yield.
                  Cryocans are also used for various other applications embryos & stem cells preservation,IVF clinics ,Dermatology and
                  shrink fitting etc. Being a signature product of BG(Cryo) holding a majority market share in the country , these are
                  also exported to Europe ,Singapore, Sri Lanka, Bangaladesh, etc. Cryocans are built to renowned IS:11552 standards.<br><br>
                
                  Bulk Storage Cryogenic containers are manufactured with Stainless steel to preserve large doses of semen in semen
                  storage and collection centers.<br><br>
                
                  Manufacturing facility has a installed capacity to produce around 25000 Cryocans per year.<br><br>
